## Description

_Duration: 3 days_

This project is a solution to the Prime Digital Academy group project of the same name. The end product meets all specs for baseline and stretch goals. The code challenge instructions are found [here](./INSTRUCTIONS.md).



To complete this project I used the following checklist to break the problem down into steps.

Base Mode Steps
<!-- TO DO -->

Stretch Mode Steps
- [x] Implement server side data validation
<!-- TO DO -->

To achieve the stretch goal... <!-- To DO -->
The styling of the interface was influenced <!-- TO DO -->

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [sweetAlert] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sweetalert)


## Installation
 
<!-- 1. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
2. Initiate the server using `node server/server.js`
3. navigate to host ip and port in browser (e.g. `127.0.0.1:5000`)
4. Enjoy!!! -->

## Usage

1. In base mode
<!--   - Enter numbers into the `First Number` and `Second Number` input fiels of Data Entry / Input area.
  -  Select an `operator` button (only one can be selected at a time). Selected button will stay depressed so you can remember which you selected.
  - Press the `=` button and the result will display to the results areas and the entire expression will be written to the server
  - Press the `C` button to clear the dta entry area without evaluation of expression.  You will have to reselect your operator as well.
  - In the history area, press the `Clear/Delete Results` button to clear the Result History and delete all results from the server.
  - In the history area you may slect one of the `displayed expressions` within it's borders to recall that expression to the data entry area.  This will over-write any input currently in the data entry area.
2. In stretch mode
  - All functionality remains the same except...
  - Instead of filling in the number inputs and selecting operator, you may use the `keypad` or type directly into the `Input Expression ` field.
  - Pressing the `=` button will send the expression to the results area as expected.
3. Mode Switching
  - To switch between `base mode` and `stretch mode` press the mode button in the banner marked `Click here for (BASE/STRETCH) MODE`. -->
